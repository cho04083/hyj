          When we talk about the different literatures of different countries;
          English literature comes to our minds first. The “English Literature”
          that I have indicated at front is not just about the British literature
          which are famous for William Shakespeare who has written many popular
          stories such as “comedy Twelfth Night, tragedy Hamlet, and history Henry IV
          , Part 1”.But there are also many famous literature books of U.S, which nowadays
          consider to be one of the leading part of the modern day literature,
          before we get start to talk about the American literature let’s put
          our interest in the backgrounds of it first; which is the history
          of the America to have an acknowledgment about how these well written
          novels of literature was born from.
