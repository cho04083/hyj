          When we talk about the different literatures of different countries;
          English literature comes to our minds first. The “English Literature”
         that I have indicated at front is not just about the British literature
          which are famous for William Shakespeare who has written many popular
         stories such as “comedy Twelfth Night, tragedy Hamlet, and history
          Henry IV, Part 1”.But there are also many famous literature books
         of U.S, which nowadays consider to be one of the leading part of
         the modern day literature, before we get start to talk about the
         American literature let’s put our interest in the backgrounds of
          it first; which is the history of the America to have an
           acknowledgment about how these well written novels of literature
           was born from.
